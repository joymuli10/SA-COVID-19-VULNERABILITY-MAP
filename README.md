# SA-COVID-19-VULNERABILITY-MAP
The repository contains models that predict the vulnerable people in risk of contracting COVID-19. Several models were used after data cleaning and exploratory analysis.

# Project Description
Covid-19 is a communicable respiratory disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that causes illness in humans. Covid-19 was first reported in China around November 2019 and later spread all over the world causing a worldwide pandemic in 2020. South Africa is currently the first country in Africa with the highest number of positive covid-19 cases at 698,184 with 18,309 deaths.
 
A census was conducted in 2011 which gave valuable information for determining who might be most vulnerable to COVID-19 in South Africa. The data is however nearly 10 years old and so itâ€™s expected that some key indicators have changed in time. The study builds an up-to-date map showing where the most vulnerables class of people are located. This will be a key step in finding ways to have a quick response to the disease.

The datasets used in this analysis were obtained from ZindiWeekendz website. They comprise of 4 datasets namely; sample, test, train and variable. 
 The train dataset has 50 unique attributes and 3,174 records while the test dataset has 49 unique attributes and 1102 records. The description dataset has 49 rows and 2 columns while the sample dataset has 1102 rows and 2 columns.
